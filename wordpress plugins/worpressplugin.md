### 3. Simple Scroll to Top Button
The “Scroll to Top” button appears at the bottom-right of the website once the visitors scrolls down a page on your website. It appears only when visitors scroll down the webpage. As a result, your website visitors can easily scroll smoothly back to the very top of a page with one click of the button.<br>
This gives your website better navigation and also adds a more professional look to your website.<br>
