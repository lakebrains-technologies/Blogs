### Problems that I have faced
a. Ensure that the files called are correct:<br>
You can check it by giving the page a particular property like background-color in the style section.<br>
b. Ensure that the images called are correct:<br>
You can check it by viewing your code first and the path and name of the respective image.<br>
c. Don’t add too many textures and colors:<br>
Use limited fonts and color. Maintain a thematic color scheme.<br>
d. Little or no social sharing options:<br>
To save yourself time and money, make sure you focus your social networks to not only what works for you but to where your customers really are.<br>
e. Poor user experience on mobile devices:<br>
When building a website you have to take into consideration all screen size variations. Often people who manage their own website will have it built to display correctly only on desktop computers.<br>
f. Websites should be periodically backed up:<br>
You must ensure your entire website is backed up so that if it were ever to go down, it can be restored at a moment’s notice.<br>
g. Lack of On-page optimization and call to action:<br>
Your prospective customer will search for your product or service in Google before they find your business online. If you want your website to show up more in Google when your customers are searching for solutions, it needs to have relevant content.<br>
